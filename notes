The limiter and helmet in your Express.js application serve crucial roles in improving the security and stability of your web service:

Express Rate Limiter (limiter)
Express Rate Limiter is middleware that helps prevent brute force attacks and other common abuses by limiting the number of requests a client can make to an API within a certain period of time. Here's a breakdown of how it works based on the example you included:

WindowMs: This specifies the duration of time where the request limits are calculated. In your setup, it's set to 15 minutes (15 * 60 * 1000 milliseconds).
Max: This defines the maximum number of requests allowed from a single IP address within the specified windowMs timeframe. You set it to 100, which means an IP can make up to 100 requests every 15 minutes before they are blocked or restricted.
The use of rate limiting is important for protecting your application against denial-of-service attacks, where an attacker might attempt to overload your server by sending a high volume of requests in a short period of time. It also helps manage the load on your server, ensuring fair use of resources among users.

Helmet
Helmet is another middleware for Express applications that sets various HTTP headers to secure your app. By default, Helmet adjusts several headers to mitigate common vulnerabilities:

XSS Filter: Helmet sets the X-XSS-Protection header to enable the Cross-site scripting (XSS) filter built into most web browsers.
Hide Powered-By: It removes the X-Powered-By header to make it harder for attackers to see what potentially vulnerable technology powers your server.
HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS): Forces browsers to use HTTPS over HTTP to access your server, enhancing security.
Frame Options: Sets the X-Frame-Options header to SAMEORIGIN by default, which can help prevent clickjacking attacks.
Content Security Policy: Helps prevent various injection attacks by restricting the sources for content types like scripts, styles, and images.
Expect-CT: Helmet can enable the Expect-CT header, which allows sites to opt in to certificate transparency enforcement.
Using Helmet is a best practice that adds another layer of protection, helping to safeguard your app against a range of web vulnerabilities by properly setting HTTP headers that instruct browsers on how to behave when handling your site's content. Together with the rate limiter, Helmet significantly enhances the security posture of your web application.
